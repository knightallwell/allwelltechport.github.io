									<h3 class="major">Data Science and Its Relevance to the World</h3>
									<p>Data science has emerged as a transformative field that powers decision-making in industries across the globe. By leveraging vast amounts of structured and unstructured data, data science provides insights that drive innovation, efficiency, and informed strategies. In today’s digital era, the ability to analyze and interpret data is critical in solving complex problems, ranging from predicting consumer behavior to managing financial risks, optimizing supply chains, and even addressing global challenges like climate change and public health. The integration of artificial intelligence, machine learning, and predictive analytics has further enhanced the value of data science, making it indispensable in shaping the future of business, technology, and society. As an accountant, I developed a strong understanding of business processes, financial analysis, and problem-solving. However, I realized that the traditional scope of accounting often limits the ability to uncover deeper insights and strategic opportunities.</p>

									<p>The rise of data science in finance and fintech presented an exciting opportunity to merge my accounting expertise with cutting-edge technologies. I became particularly drawn to areas such as fraud detection, risk management, and AI-driven financial modeling, where data science enables proactive solutions rather than reactive measures. My goal is to leverage data science to make impactful contributions that align with my passion for innovation and my foundation in accounting.</p>
									<h3 class="major"> My Journey to Building a Career in Data Science</h3>
									<p>To successfully navigate this transition, I have embarked on a structured journey of learning and application. I have obtained the IBM Data Science Professional Certificate and completed projects involving machine learning, predictive analytics, and deep learning, such as building a crack detection model using PyTorch and ResNet-18. I am actively pursuing further education, including an MBA with a specialization in Artificial Intelligence, Fintech, and Blockchain at Nexford University.
										
										Additionally, I continuously refine my technical skills in Python programming, exploratory data analysis, and feature engineering, while applying them to real-world problems. By integrating my knowledge of accounting with data science methodologies, I aim to create solutions that enhance business growth, stability, and profitability. My journey is driven by a commitment to learning, applying, and contributing to the dynamic and impactful field of data science.</p>

									<h3 class="major">Cetification</h3>
									<p>I hold certifications from Google and IBM, showcasing my expertise in data analytics, artificial intelligence, and data science. While these are highlights of my achievements, they are only a part of the broader qualifications I have acquired to excel in this field. My journey reflects a deep commitment to continuous learning, innovation, and applying data-driven solutions to real-world challenges</p>
